# Active Task Map

Updated: 2026-07-02

Purpose: fast recovery and orchestration continuity. This file tracks only work that still needs
attention: blockers, active workers, complete-but-unreviewed branches, pending corrections, and
cleanup that affects current work.

Update this file as the last step before ending an orchestration operation. Do not add a task here
just because it was launched if the same operation will immediately complete, review, merge, or
otherwise resolve it.

## Active Tasks

None.

## Blockers

- `npm run build:tauri` is blocked until Rust/Cargo are installed or available on `PATH`.

## Cleanup Notes

Leave Windows-locked physical leftover worktree folders in place unless an explicit cleanup task is
launched:

- Worker 019: `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\282a\Codex Orchestrator`
- Worker 021: `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\fae3\Codex Orchestrator`
- Worker 022: `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\cea2\Codex Orchestrator`
- Worker 023: `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\14b0\Codex Orchestrator`
