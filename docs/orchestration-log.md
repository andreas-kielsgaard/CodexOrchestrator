### Worker 001: Bootstrap App Skeleton

- Status: reviewed and merged
- Pending worktree id: `local:7b75b815-bcb4-41f3-b012-3e2fd533ac93`
- Starting branch: `main`
- Worker branch: `worker/001-bootstrap`
- Worker commit: `07f2c6366a33564d126485f35c60a17d5b94da12`
- Merge commit: `5a246f2`
- Reasoning effort: `medium`
- Scope: bootstrap project skeleton, developer tooling, README, minimal Open Tasks dashboard placeholder, and task result log.
- Context policy: worker prompt used concise visible context plus pointers to `docs/orchestration-context.md` and `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`; no hidden model context was serialized.
- Expected result log: `docs/task-logs/worker-001-bootstrap.md`
- Orchestrator thread id for completion prompt: `019f1f79-0e23-7e13-9518-d31dfe843dc9`
- Review correction: tightened dashboard CSS so all five attention groups fit at 1280px without internal horizontal scroll.
- Verification after merge: `npm install`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Known blocker: `npm run build:tauri` fails because `cargo` is not installed or not on `PATH`.
- Cleanup: archived worker thread `019f1f86-6f0d-7753-a1d1-f6fd3414a67d`, removed Git worktree registration, and deleted merged branch `worker/001-bootstrap`.
- Cleanup note: Windows kept an empty leftover directory locked at `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\15ac\Codex Orchestrator`; retry later after the app releases the handle.

### Admin Correction: Worker Reporting Contract

- Status: applied
- Commit: `b7096b3`
- Summary: added `docs/orchestration-learnings.md` and updated the worker completion contract to require branch creation, final commits, commit SHAs, exact branch status, and tighter completion reports.

### Admin Correction: Line Ending Policy

- Status: applied
- Commit: `19bfe9e`
- Summary: added `.gitattributes` so Prettier checks stay stable on Windows with `core.autocrlf=true`.

### Worker 002: Domain Model And Dashboard Projection

- Status: reviewed and merged
- Pending worktree id: `local:43eae478-1db6-4d6b-8e7b-03c3ff0a91d9`
- Starting branch: `main`
- Base commit: `4d9af770677d444122cac31a3e18876ff051933b`
- Worker branch: `worker/002-domain-model`
- Worker commit: `8550e77`
- Merge commit: `39b4eb4`
- Reasoning effort: `medium`
- Scope: add TypeScript domain types, seed/demo records, dashboard projection logic, and tests without SQLite, Tauri persistence commands, or Codex runtime integration.
- Context policy: worker prompt used concise visible context plus pointers to `docs/orchestration-context.md`, `docs/orchestration-learnings.md`, and `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`; no hidden model context was serialized.
- Expected result log: `docs/task-logs/worker-002-domain-model.md`
- Orchestrator thread id for completion prompt: `019f1f79-0e23-7e13-9518-d31dfe843dc9`
- Review correction: changed `Task.conversationId` to `Task.conversationIds` so tasks can link to multiple conversations; corrected the Worker 002 seed conversation thread id.
- Accepted decision: `running` plus `waiting_on_agent` projects to `Working`; non-running `waiting_on_agent` projects to `Waiting`.
- Verification after merge: `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Context reuse note: Worker 002 was started fresh because the domain projection slice was independent from Worker 001's bootstrap context; future correction/debug tasks may continue an existing worker when that context is useful.
- Cleanup: archived worker thread `019f1f99-5c3f-7961-874e-6af58a7c3ec5`, pruned stale Git worktree registration, and deleted merged branch `worker/002-domain-model`.
- Cleanup note: physical Codex worktree folders remain at `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\eaeb\Codex Orchestrator` and `C:\Users\user\.codex\worktrees\15ac\Codex Orchestrator`; Git no longer tracks them as worktrees.

### Admin Correction: Worker Context Reuse Rule

- Status: applied
- Commit: `5693f14`
- Summary: updated orchestration behavior notes to require an explicit fresh-vs-continued worker conversation decision based on context usefulness.
